    MediaFlow Proxy doesn't actually have a UI - this file is here to provide you with the essential information you need to use it.

    Your MediaFlow Proxy URL is:
    https://{{ .Release.Name }}-mediaflow-proxy.{{ .Values.dns_domain }}

    You would have either picked your own password upon purchase, or you'll need to
    set one using an environment variable (you can also use this workflow to change the password)

    Using FileBrowser, open the console, and paste in:
    elfbot env mediaflow-proxy API_PASSWORD=whatevermypasswordis

    MediaFlow Proxy will restart, and and your new password applied.
