    ## 🎞 Get the best quality

    Plex sometimes defaults to low quality or shows its own adverts first. "
          "Here’s how to fix that:

    1. **Set streaming quality to original** – Settings → Playback  
    2. **Enable hardware decoding** if your device supports it for smoother 4K.  
    3. **Prefer Ethernet over Wi-Fi** on smart-TVs.

    *Happy viewing!* 🍿
