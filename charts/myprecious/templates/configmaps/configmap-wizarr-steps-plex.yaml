    ## 🎞 Get the best quality

    Plex sometimes defaults to low quality or shows its own adverts first. "
          "Here’s how to fix that:

    1. **Disable trailers & extras** – Settings → Experience → untick *Show cinematic trailers*  
    2. **Force original quality** – Settings → Playback → set *Automatic* to *Original*  
    3. **Use a wired connection** if you’re on a smart-TV for stutter-free 4K.
    4. **Read the [Plex Guide](https://plexguide.com/){target=_blank .btn}** to learn more

    *Happy viewing!* 🍿
